👋 &nbsp;Hi, I’m @n-fasano.  
👀 &nbsp;I’m interested in all matters of computer science, from bare metal to high-level abstractions.  
🌱 &nbsp;I’m currently working as a web developer, but I'm always looking to improve my understanding of **lower-level languages** and **networking**.  
💞️ &nbsp;I’m most familiar with the **PHP** and the **Javascript** ecosystems, and their different frameworks and tools such as: 
* Symfony, Composer, PHPUnit
* Vue, Node.js, Express  

I also like to write **Bash** scripts for **automation** and simplifying workflows.
