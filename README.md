👋 Hi, I’m @NFLorD.  
👀 I’m interested in all matters of computer science, from bare metal to high-level abstractions.  
🌱 I’m currently working as a web developer, but I'm always looking to improve my understanding of **lower-level languages** and **networking**.  
💞️ I’m most familiar with the **PHP** and the **Javascript** ecosystems, and their different frameworks and tools such as: 
* **Symfony**, **Composer**, **PHPUnit**
* **VueJS**, **NodeJS**, **Express**  

I also like to write **Bash** scripts for **automation** and simplifying workflows.
